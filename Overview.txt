Restate Problem Statement:
A functioning PID manager must be able to allocate a unique PID to each running process.
In addition to allocation, it must also deallocate PIDs when processes are terminated,
either by choice or via an error.  We are tasked with implementing a PID manager that can
allocate and deallocate PIDs via a bitmap; ensuring to check for errors in all relevant operations.

Assumptions: N/A

Language: Python
